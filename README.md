# AngularJS-Form-Visibility
AngularJS application in order to show or hide visibility of UI form based elements.

Code is written in HTML, AngularJS. You can find controller code in seperate javascript file created using AngularJS. 
If you check the UI, its pretty interactive since changing text in the field box changes the value in view. When you press Hide/Show 
button the form would become invisible and on pressing the button again, it would become visible.

This is a frontend example with no backend so you can directly run it on firefox with adding any server.
